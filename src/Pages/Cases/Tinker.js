              As real estate investing becomes increasingly popular, many small
              landlords entering the industry struggle to find reliable
              contractors quickly, resulting in delayed maintenance issues and
              poor tenant experience.

              That's why me and my team created Tinker, an AI-powered

              Both of my parents are landlords, and they rely heavily on
              word-of-mouth recommendations and had to call around to find
              reliable contractors. They usually have a multiple contractors
              they're going back and forth with at the same time, and finding
              good contractors who offer great services at competitive cost but
              also available are often very difficult and extremely time
              consuming. This process is highly inefficient, often leading to

                We hopped on calls with 20+ landlords from a large range of
                locations and experience levels and asked about their experience
                with being a landlord, maintenance orders, and finding
                contractors.
              </p>
              <p>
                They all found the process tedious, time consuming, and
                confusing, especially those who had just entered the industry.
                Current platforms are unreliable and over saturated, and still
                require landlords to go out of their way to filter through a
                large number of contractors on their own.

                job and finding projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                We found that smaller contractors say that finding work is
                difficult and they find they customer side of their job
                incredibly draining, as customers are constantly trying to
                haggle prices. Even after a lot of back and forth with a
                landlord, the project isn't gauranteed to be theirs.

            The bulkiest part of this app design was the user flow. Since there
            were so many users, we had to make sure that each flow was
            incredibly thought out to result in the most ideal experience for
            all use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also important to note that this project was under the time

          <p>
            From these baseline user flows, I designed the basic iteration of
            the 3 flows and rapidly iterated multiple times on each following
            user and stakeholder interviews and feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            The contractor's experience represented an huge design challenge and
            involved a multitude of iterations. I started by researching other
            applications with similar user journeys such as Uber for drivers,
            Upwork and AirBnB. I also tested a range of different interaction
            design options, including requiring contractors go “live” to accept
            work orders, sending contractors notifications when there was a work
            order in their area.

            My final interaction was having all currently available projects for
            contractors to browse through when they want to look for a job, both
            in list and map form.

            Another example of iterations I made was in the status component.
            This component is to show landlords the progress on their projects.
            I started with just a status bar based on time, but I soon realized
            that in reality, Landlords wouldn't care as much about how the
            project is faring time-wise, and its a relatively inaccurate form of
            measurement of status. So instead, I opted to use stages to show
            status.

        <h3>Branding</h3>
          <img src={designSystem}id="designSystem"></img>
        <p>
          My main goal with the design system is to create a simple yet
          meaningful brand identity. I made sure{" "}
          <span className="underlined">simplicity</span> was the most important
          by identifying a couple key colors to hone in on the brand identity
          without over-complicating the design. I made sure to create styles
          that the developers can consistently replicate.

        <h3>Components</h3>
          <img src={components} id="designSystem"></img>
        <p>
          Creating a <span className="bold">scalable</span> design system in
          terms of components was also incredibly vital for our development
          process. Making sure every design aligned with a basic design system
          was one of my overarching rules when designing.

          <h3>1. Getting feedback is so important.</h3>
          <p>
            After working on the same idea everyday for an extended period of
            time, it was difficult for me to see beyond my current designs.
            Asking other designers and users for feedback on my designs helped
            me open my eyes to inherent flaws in my designs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="takeaway">
          <h3>2. Less is more.</h3>
          <p>
            As a designer, it can be easy to do too much, making it difficult
            for the user to navigate. During my design process, I realized that
            having a simple and scalable design system makes it easy both for me
            as a designer and for my developers. Since we were in a time
            constraint, keeping it simple was vital.

        <div className="takeaway">
          <h3>3. Design is all-encompassing.</h3>
          <p>
            I'm someone who usually sticks to my strengths, and within design,
            I've always thought that that was UI/UX. Doing this project has made
            me realize that as a designer, I need to be skilled in all facets of
            design (branding, graphic, product, and more) in order to be make a
            successful product. Design can be and is more than just your
            individual niche.
